---

This is a sample reverse engineering case study in the style of Wrongbaud.  

**Objective:** Explore STM32 microcontroller JTAG connections and document the process.  

**Process:**  
- Identified JTAG pins on STM board  
- Used openOCD + hardware debugger  
- Extracted firmware and analyzed memory maps  
- Documented limitations and ethical considerations  

**Result:** Demonstrated a reproducible RE workflow with educational value.
