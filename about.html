    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a reverse engineer specializing in embedded systems, firmware analysis, and low-level debugging. 
      This site is a collection of my case studies, write-ups, and experiments across hardware and software reverse engineering. 
      My focus is on practical demonstrations of techniques, and breaking down complex topics into clear, applicable steps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this portfolio is to showcase what can be achieved through methodical analysis of firmware, hardware protocols, and security implementations. 
      I also aim to document lessons learned, methodologies, and useful tooling for other engineers and researchers.
    </p>

    <h3>Areas of Expertise</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Firmware reverse engineering (ARM Cortex, MIPS, x86)</li>
      <li>Debugging and protocol analysis (SWD, JTAG, UART, SPI, I²C)</li>
      <li>Binary analysis, disassembly, and decompilation (Ghidra, IDA Pro, Radare2)</li>
      <li>Exploit research and vulnerability discovery in embedded devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Professional Engagements</h3>
    <p>
      I provide consulting and training for organizations and individuals who want to strengthen their capabilities in reverse engineering and firmware security. 
      This includes hands-on instruction, project-based collaboration, and technical reviews of embedded systems.
    </p>
